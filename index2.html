                        George Harrison was the lead guitarist of The Beatles and a key contributor to their legendary sound. Born in 1943 in Liverpool, he brought a unique style to the band, blending rock with Indian classical influences. Though often overshadowed by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, he wrote some of The Beatles' most beloved songs, including Something and Here Comes the Sun.
                        After the band's breakup, Harrison found great success as a solo artist, releasing the acclaimed album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7j7lsExGJtBHLgDYzjclwk?si=N4r3dkKNRwKOsJR7useA6w" target="_blank">All Things Must Pass</a>. He also organized The Concert for Bangladesh in 1971, one of the first major charity concerts. A deeply spiritual person, he was instrumental in introducing Indian music and philosophy to Western audiences. Harrison's influence continues to inspire musicians worldwide.

                        John Lennon was a founding member of The Beatles, known for his sharp wit, poetic lyrics, and rebellious spirit. Born in 1940 in Liverpool, he played a key role in shaping the band's sound with songs like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3KfbEIOC7YIv90FIfNSZpo?si=39e7b8cbfc124138">In my Life</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3Am0IbOxmvlSXro7N5iSfZ?si=e2083ebe14094bc4">Strawberry Fields Forever</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/68BTFws92cRztMS1oQ7Ewj?si=a2575317353648cb">All You Need Is Love</a>.    
                        Beyond music, Lennon became a vocal peace activist, famously promoting non-violence with campaigns like "Bed-In for Peace" alongside his wife, Yoko Ono. <a href="aboutLennonsDeath.html">His life was tragically cut short in 1980</a>, but his legacy as a musician, dreamer, and advocate for change continues to inspire the world.
