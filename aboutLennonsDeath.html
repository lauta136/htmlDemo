        <p>On December 8, 1980, John Lennon was assassinated outside his New York home, the Dakota building. Mark David Chapman, a 25-year-old fan from Hawaii, shot Lennon four times in the back. Chapman had earlier asked Lennon for an autograph, making the murder even more chilling. But why did Chapman commit this act? Over the years, several theories have emerged.</p>

                <summary><em>The “Catcher in the Rye” Obsession</em></summary>
                <p>
                    Chapman was obsessed with The Catcher in the Rye, a novel by J.D. Salinger. He claimed he identified with the book’s protagonist, Holden Caulfield, who despised “phonies.” Chapman believed Lennon was a hypocrite for preaching peace and love while living a wealthy lifestyle. After the murder, Chapman was found calmly reading the book, reportedly saying, “This is my statement.”

                <summary><em>Religious Fanaticism</em></summary>
                <p>Chapman was raised in a strict Christian household and later became highly religious. He reportedly felt betrayed by Lennon’s famous 1966 statement that The Beatles were “more popular than Jesus.” Some speculate that his deep religious beliefs and Lennon's perceived blasphemy pushed him to commit the murder.</p>

                <summary><em>A Desire for Fame</em></summary>
                <p>Some believe Chapman was driven by a desire to be famous. He allegedly idolized celebrities but also wanted to "become someone." Killing Lennon, one of the most famous musicians in history, would ensure his name was remembered. This aligns with the psychological concept of “celebrity worship gone wrong.”</p>

                <summary><em> CIA Conspiracy Theory</em></summary>
                A more controversial theory suggests that Lennon was assassinated due to his political activism. Throughout the 1970s, Lennon was outspoken against war, capitalism, and the U.S. government. He supported leftist movements and was under FBI surveillance. Some theorists believe Chapman was a Manchurian candidate—a brainwashed assassin used by the CIA to silence Lennon before he could influence another generation. However, no solid evidence supports this claim.
